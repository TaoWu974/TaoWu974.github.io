The **Portfolio Analytics Platform (PA)** turns raw fund performance data into clear stories that support faster
investment decisions. Built for research and strategy teams, the project focuses on delivering trustworthy metrics,
sleek visualizations, and collaboration-friendly workflows in one place.

### What makes it different

* **Unified data processing:** Automated ingestion pipelines connect to custodians, benchmarks, and market data
  providers, ensuring analysts always work with the latest numbers.
* **Scenario planning:** Interactive modules let teams model allocations, stress-test macro scenarios, and instantly
  share results as PDF or slide exports.
* **Explainable insights:** Every chart highlights the drivers behind performance through built-in annotations,
  sensitivity indicators, and links to the supporting research notes.

### Implementation highlights

1. A modular ETL architecture orchestrated through Airflow keeps the platform resilient when new data sources are
   onboarded.
2. React-based dashboards powered by D3 visualizations remain responsive on tablets used by traveling relationship
   managers.
3. Role-based access control integrates with the firm's SSO provider to balance transparency with compliance.

### Outcomes

Early adopters reduced the time spent preparing quarterly review materials by more than 60%, freeing analysts to focus
on uncovering new opportunities. The platform's transparency also helped win two new mandates during its pilot rollout
thanks to clearer communication with prospective clients.
