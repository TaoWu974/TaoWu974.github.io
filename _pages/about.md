Hi, I'm a third year PhD student in Electronic Engineering with James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK, advised by [Prof. Bo Liu](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/boliu/). I obtained a BEng degree in Electronic Engineering from University of Glasgow, a BEng degree in Electronic Engineering from UESTC, and an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA. I have also worked at MathWorks as a research intern.

My research interests lies in the intersection of artifical intelligence (AI) and radio frequency (RF) designs. I leaverage few-shot learning enhanced optimization and large language models (LLMs) to help RF engineers engage with efficient design. I have developed and upgraded optimization methods for RF designs, including proposing a new optimization method for pixelized antennas with a resolution of 2000 or higher ([IEEE TAP](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/352578/)), and refining optimization methods for microwave filters (also used for photonic filters [ECOC2025](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/359591/)) and power amplifers ([IEEE TMTT](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/329166/)). Recently, my work looks at digitalizing and streamlining RF design workflow by using LLMs ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18271) & [GitHub](https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM)).
